<h1>Who Is Shannon P. Drake?</h1>
<p>Hacker, web programmer, friend to black cats, Shannon P. Drake began his tenure as the most horrifying thing imaginable: a creative that wound up in PR and Marketing. After over a decade bouncing around the world, he decided the time had come to stay in one place. With everything from an A+ certification to publishing credits on obscure role-playing games, Shannon brings the skills and expertise to build a website, hack the website, and then make the website better. When it absolutely, positively has to get done, accept no substitutes.</p>
